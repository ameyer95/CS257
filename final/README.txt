Final project for Software Design, CS 257 at Carleton College, Spring 2017 with professor Jeff Ondich
Patty Commins and Anna Meyer

We built Conway's Game of Life as our final project. The user selects some subset of "cells" to be "alive" and then the simulation charts the "population" over time using the rules:
1) If a cell is alive and has 2 or 3 alive neighbors, it remains alive in the next round.
2) If a cell is dead and has exactly 3 alive neighbors, it is alive in the next round.
3) Otherwise, a cell is dead in the following round.
