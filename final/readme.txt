Patty Commins and Anna Meyer

We will build the game of life. The user will be able to select which cells are "alive" at the start. Then the simulation will run either until completion or until the user chooses to stop. The main screen will have the game board, as well as a small control panel containing the number of steps, speed, and start, stop, and pause buttons. There will also be an option to graph the population thoughout a particular simulation.

Classes we need:
Main
Controller
Box (each square on the game grid will be an individual object with a position and alive/dead status)
